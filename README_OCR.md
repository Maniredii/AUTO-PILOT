# EasyApplyBot with OCR Job Description Reading

## üöÄ New Features Added

The EasyApplyBot now includes **Computer Vision + OCR** capabilities to read and analyze job descriptions before applying. This enables:

- **Smart Job Filtering**: Automatically skip jobs that don't match your criteria
- **Red Flag Detection**: Identify problematic job postings (unpaid, no benefits, etc.)
- **Skill Matching**: Match your skills with job requirements
- **Experience Level Checking**: Ensure job level matches your experience
- **Tech Stack Analysis**: Identify relevant technologies in job descriptions

## üìã Requirements

### Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install opencv-python pytesseract Pillow numpy
```

### Tesseract OCR Engine (Required for OCR functionality)

#### Windows Installation:
1. Download from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
2. Install the latest version (e.g., tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-5.3.1.20230401.exe)
3. **Important**: During installation, check "Add to PATH" option
4. Restart your terminal/IDE after installation

#### macOS Installation:
```bash
brew install tesseract
```

#### Linux Installation:
```bash
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

## üîß Configuration

Add your skills and preferences to `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# User Skills and Preferences for Job Matching
userSkills:
  - Python
  - JavaScript
  - Java
  - React
  - Node.js
  - AWS
  - SQL
  - Machine Learning
  - Data Analysis
  - Web Development

userTechStack:
  - Python
  - JavaScript
  - React
  - Node.js
  - AWS
  - SQL
  - MongoDB
  - Docker
  - Git
  - Agile
  - Scrum

userExperienceLevel: mid  # Options: junior, mid, senior
preferRemote: true
minSalary: 50000
maxSalary: 150000
```

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Job Description Capture**: Takes a screenshot of the job description area
2. **OCR Processing**: Uses computer vision to extract text from the image
3. **Text Analysis**: Analyzes the extracted text for key information
4. **Smart Decision Making**: Determines whether to apply based on:
   - Red flags (unpaid, no benefits, etc.)
   - Experience level compatibility
   - Skill requirements match
   - Remote work preferences
   - Tech stack overlap

## üö® Alternative: Text-Based Analysis (No OCR Required)

If you don't want to install Tesseract OCR, the bot can still work using LinkedIn's HTML content:

```python
# In linkedineasyapply.py, modify the read_job_description_ocr method
def read_job_description_text_only(self, job_element=None):
    """
    Read job description using HTML text instead of OCR
    """
    try:
        if job_element is None:
            # Find job description container
            job_element = self.browser.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "jobs-search__job-details--container")
        
        # Get text directly from HTML
        job_text = job_element.text
        return job_text
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error reading job description: {str(e)}")
        return ""
```

## üß™ Testing

Run the test script to verify OCR functionality:

```bash
python test_ocr.py
```

## üìä Job Analysis Output

When the bot runs, you'll see detailed analysis like:

```
Reading job description with OCR...
Job Description Analysis:
  Experience Level: mid
  Remote Work: true
  Salary Mentioned: true
  Tech Stack: python, aws, sql, docker
  ‚úÖ Job analysis suggests this is a good fit. Proceeding with application.
```

## üîç Red Flag Detection

The bot automatically detects and skips jobs with:
- Unpaid positions
- Volunteer work
- Commission-only compensation
- No benefits mentioned
- Excessive overtime requirements
- 24/7 on-call requirements

## üí° Tips for Best Results

1. **Install Tesseract OCR** for full functionality
2. **Customize your skills** in config.yaml to match your profile
3. **Set experience level** appropriately (junior/mid/senior)
4. **Configure salary ranges** to filter out low-paying jobs
5. **Enable remote preference** if you prefer remote work

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### OCR Not Working:
- Ensure Tesseract is installed and in PATH
- Restart terminal/IDE after installation
- Check if the job description area is visible on screen

### Poor Text Recognition:
- Ensure good screen resolution
- Avoid browser zoom levels other than 100%
- Make sure job description is fully loaded

### Performance Issues:
- OCR processing adds 2-5 seconds per job
- Consider using text-based analysis for faster processing
- Batch process jobs during off-peak hours

## üéâ Benefits

- **Higher Quality Applications**: Only apply to suitable jobs
- **Time Savings**: Skip jobs that don't match your criteria
- **Better Success Rate**: Focus on jobs where you're a good fit
- **Professional Approach**: Make informed decisions about applications
- **Red Flag Avoidance**: Skip problematic job postings automatically
